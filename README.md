#Two Rooms
Two rooms is a mobile adaptation of the card game "Two Rooms and a Boom!" It was built as a hobby project and a way for me to familiarize myself with the Meteor framework. If you have any suggestions on how I could improve my code or style, please drop me a line. Also, if you'd like to try out the app, it's currently hosted at [tworoomsapp.com](http://tworoomsapp.com).

##Disclaimer
Two rooms and a boom was designed by Alan Gerding and Sean McCoy, and is currently published by [Tuesday Knight Games](http://tuesdayknightgames.com/tworoomsandaboom/). This is an unofficial fan project, and is not endorsed in any way by the original creators, but feel free to support them anyway by [picking up a copy of their game!](http://tuesdayknightgames.com/tworoomsandaboom/)
